/**
*Wallis' formula is usually used for integrating functions like:
*sinnx
*cosnx
*within the bound of Ï€/2 to 0.
*
*Your task is to find the value of the integrated function. It doesn't depend whether the function is sin or cos. It depends on the power of the function only.
*
*If it is an even number, answer is multiplied by Ï€/2; otherwise it is not.
